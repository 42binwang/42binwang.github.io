About
===

I am currently a senior student at [Jilin University](http://www.jlu.edu.cn), majoring in Computer Science, aiming to be a full stack engineer in my career.  ; -)

Familiar with C, C++( 70% familiar with C++11 & C++14 ), Python(   Django, Web2py, TurboGears, Scrapy and etc. ), Java( lucene, Velocity, Spring, entry level of android programming & hadoop ), Scacle, C#( WPF ), Multiple threads( MPI, OpenMP, pthread ), Objective-c, swift, html, css, javascript, php and etc.

I will pick some of my projects to put them on the Github in the following month. You can follow me on [this](https://github.com/42binwang?tab=repositories) if you are interested about them.

__Why 42?__

The prefix number 42 of my domain name is originated from [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), a comedy science fiction series created by [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams). 42 is the answer to [the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29).
